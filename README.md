# TunnelMan-Game
A 2D game using object-oriented programming (school project). 

How to play the game: 

In this game you can control the Tunnel Man by using arrow-keys/WASD. The goal is to collect all the barrels of oil hidden in the oil field, at which point you will advance to a more difficult level. However, protesters are also scouring the oil field- if a protester comes near the Tunnel Man they will cause his HP to decrease. If you find a gold nugget, you can press tab near a protester and it will bribe the protester to leave the oil field. Similarly, you can press space to squirt water at a protester and annoy them to the point of leaving. Lastly, if all the ground beneath a boulder is removed, it will fall. It if hits a protestor it will immediately cause them to leave, and if it hits the player you will lose a life.
